# U.S. States Guessing Game 🗺️🇺🇸

**U.S. States Guessing Game** is an educational and fun game where you test your knowledge of U.S. geography by guessing the names of states. The game visually displays each correctly guessed state on a map! 🧠🎯

## Project Overview 📚

This project is developed using **Python** and the **Turtle** graphics library. It prompts users to input the names of U.S. states, and if the guess is correct, the state name appears on the map. The game tracks the number of correct guesses and provides an option to save the states you still need to learn. 🌍📝

## Features 🎨

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Guess the names of U.S. states, and see them appear on a map as you guess correctly.
- 🧠 **Learning Tool**: Helps improve your knowledge of U.S. geography by keeping track of the states you still need to learn.
- 💾 **Progress Saving**: Save a list of states that you didn’t guess correctly for future study.

## Programming Language and Libraries 🛠️

- **Python**: The core language used to build the game.
- **Turtle**: A Python library used for creating the map and handling user interactions.
- **Pandas**: Used to manage state data and track user progress.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Load the Map**: A map of the U.S. is loaded using the Turtle graphics library.
2. **Input State Names**: Users are prompted to guess the name of a state.
3. **Display on Map**: Correctly guessed states are displayed on the map at their corresponding locations.
4. **Track Progress**: The game keeps track of how many states have been guessed correctly.
5. **Save Learning Data**: If the user exits the game, they can save a list of states they still need to learn.
